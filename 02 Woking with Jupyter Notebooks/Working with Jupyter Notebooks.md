# Interactive Coding with Jupyter Notebooks


When we do data analysis for research, we often want to explore our data
interactively and document this process to retrace it later. Jupyter
notebooks are a great tool for this because they provide an interactive
environment for writing text and running code. Thus, we can have our
code, text that explains the code as well as the output produced by that
code, like figures, all in the same document! In this notebook, we are
going to explore the basics of working with Jupyter notebooks in VSCode.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks support many different programming languages like
Python, R and Julia. The notebooks themselves are just text documents
with a specialized formatting. If we want to run code in a notebook, we
must provide a **kernel** which is the computational engine for
executing the code. In our case, the kernel is the conda environment we
created for the respective project. We also need a specific package
called `ipykernel` which acts as a bridge that communicates between
kernel and the notebook interface. Once the notebook is connected to the
kernel, we can start running code in it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 1**</span> Create a new
environment with `conda create -n test_jupyter`, then activate that
environment and use `conda install python=3.13 ipykernel` to install
Python and the IPython kernel.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 2**</span> Split your VSCode
editor by pressing `Ctrl+/` or by clicking on the button labeled “Split
Editor Right” in the top right corner. Then, use the file explorer on
the left to open `Welcome to Jupyter.ipynb` in the new split.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 3**</span> Click on the “Select
Kernel” button and click “Select Another Kernel” then choose “Select
Another Kernel” \> “Python Environments” and select the newly created
`test_jupyter` environment. Observe how the text in the code cells is
now being highlighted!

**Note for Windows users**: if `test_jupyter` does not show up on the
list, it means that VSCode can’t find conda. To fix this, close VSCode,
open the program “Miniforge Prompt” and launch VSCode from there by
simply typing `code` and hitting enter. Then, try again.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 4**</span> Execute both code
cells in the notebook and observe the output.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 5**</span> Run the entire
notebook by clicking “Run All”

## Creating your First Notebook

Now that we know how to use a notebook, it is time to create our own!
Creating a notebook works like creating any other text file, just
remember to add the file extension `.ipynb` (for Interactive Python
Notebook) - this will tell VSCode to treat this file as a Jupyter
notebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 6**</span> Click on the “New
File” button that appears at the top when you hover over the VSCode file
explorer and create a file called `my_first_notebook.ipynb`. Then, open
the file and select the `test_jupyter` kernel.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 7**</span> Create a new code cell
in your notebook by clicking on the “+ Code” button. In this cell, enter
the following code:

``` python
print("Hi Notebook!")
```

Then, run the cell

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 8**</span> Create another code
cell and enter the following code:

``` python
! conda env list
```

The exclamation point tells the notebook that the executed code contains
a command for the terminal.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 9**</span> Save your notebook,
either by hitting `Ctrl + S` or by clicking “File”\>“Save” in the top
left corner of VSCode.

## Managing the State of a Notebook

Jupyter keeps track of your notebook’s state which means that it
remembers the code that you have executed and the output that was
generated by that code. This is great for interactive development and
exploration because it allows us to make small changes and see their
effect without having to rerun the entire notebook. However, this can
also result in problems if the order in which code cells are executed is
varied. In this section, we’ll explore managing the notebook’s state and
the pitfalls that this can bring with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 10**</span> Open the notebook
`managing_state.ipynb`, select the `test_jupyter` environment as your
kernel and run all three cells in the notebook.

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 11**</span> Now “Restart” the
notebook and, after restarting, execute only the second cell. What error
message do you get?

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 12**</span> Run the whole
notebook by using the “Run All” function

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 13**</span> Open the notebook
`riddle.ipynb` and find out in which order the cells must be executed so
that the code runs without error.

## Writing Markdown

The text cells in a Jupyter notebook are formatted using markdown, a
simple yet powerful markup language. It is the same language that is
used in this document. Markdown has become the de facto standard in
software because it is simple, compatible across platforms and can
easily be converted to other formats (e.g. HTML, PDF). In this section,
we are going to explore the basics of formatting text with markdown.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code># Title</code></td>
<td>Format the text <code>Title</code> as a heading level 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>## Subtitle</code></td>
<td>Format the text <code>Subtitle</code> as a heading level 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>- first item</code></td>
<td>Item in an unordered list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1. first item</code></td>
<td>Item in an ordered list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>This is *italicized*.</code></td>
<td>Italice the text betwee the asterisks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>This is **bold**</code></td>
<td>Make the text between the double asterisks bold</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>[Google](google.com)</code></td>
<td>Link to a website</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>![Figure 1](./figure1.png)</code></td>
<td>Embed an image</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<span class="theorem-title">**Exercise 14**</span> Create a new notebook
called `intro_to_markdown.ipynb` and open it.
